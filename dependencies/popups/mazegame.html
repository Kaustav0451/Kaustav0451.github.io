						<div class="blog-slider__title">Project Overview</div>
						<div class="blog-slider__text">This was done as a college practical project.
							I was supposed to make a game and somehow include mazes in it.
							<div class="mobiledisable">I came up with a small story for the game.
								The game had a maze implemented using a randomized DFS algorithm.
								It was a turn based multiplayer game which could be played over the local network.
								The players had to move to their enemies location. Whoever went there first won the game.
								This game was partially inspired from chess.

						<div class="blog-slider__title">Time of Work</div>
						<div class="blog-slider__text">This was done as a college project and took about 2 weeks to complete.
							<div class="mobiledisable">
								The most time consuming part was coming up with algorithms to simulate the maze.
								GUI was not difficult to implement due to prior experience with Java GUI.
								Implementing sockets for LAN multiplayer was again time consuming as it was not well documented in the docs of SDL libraries.

						<span class="blog-slider__code">Major Challenge: Multiplayer Implementation</span>
						<div class="blog-slider__title">Resources Used and Skills Learnt</div>
						<div class="blog-slider__text">Major resource was youtube tutorials and SDL2 library documentaion.
							Result of this project was better understanding of maze-making and maze-solving algorithms.
							<div class="mobiledisable">
								Implementing multiplayer, interrupts, resource allocation within a segmented game etc were some skills learnt
								in the process of developing the game. Parallel Programming was avoided to keep CPU loads low in GUI applications.
								A better maze algorithm was later developed but was too complex to be put in a game and has been made as a separate program.
								I consider that to be of the project as the skill-set is quite closely related.
