						<div class="blog-slider__title">Project Overview</div>
						<div class="blog-slider__text">Game making was one of my top priorities since childhood.
							During my first year of college I finally started developing an Open-World game prototype.
							<div class="mobiledisable">Deciding Game Engine was a challenge. I went with Unreal because of its visual scripting feature.
							It took me a few days to understand the engine to work with it.
							Within 3 weeks I was able to make a simple game with a story and 4 mazes. The player had to find a treasure in the maze.
							After knowing the neccessery features, I started making the prototype and was testing my game regularly.
							Game's FPS was a problem, because your code have to be very optimised so that it can run on maximum PCs smoothly.
							Optimization was a serious priority for us.
							After making the game, a friend made a short youtube video to showcase the project,
							and uploaded the game on drive to make it available for friends to download.
							There was plan to publish the prototype on Epic Games Store as a template for begineers to understand fundamentals and linking of different systems.
							But this idea was later scrapped as it had become too complex for begineers to get grasp on.</div>

						<div class="blog-slider__text">I mainly used youtube and Unreal official documantation for reference.
							<div class="mobiledisable">For ingame models I used mainly Blender and various 3-D modelling websites on the internet like Sketchfab, Free3D etc.
							I also used CC3 and Adobe Mixamo for making charecters.
							I also used free example projects on Unreal marketplace as reference for a few in-game mechanics.</div>
