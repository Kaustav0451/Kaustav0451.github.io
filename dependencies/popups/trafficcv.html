						<div class="blog-slider__title">Project Overview</div>
						<div class="blog-slider__text">This is an OpenCV project done by me as a means to get better insights into computer vision.
							This project was done entirely in C++ and not python. 
							<div class="mobiledisable">The main reason for this optimization is that C++ is better optimized for getting tasks done faster.
								OpenCV seemed like a great tool for this as it hides several lower level implementation and their optimization and
								helps us understand fundamental work flow for computer vision. The main task was to take in a video as input.
								It may or may not be live-feed. The video was then processed and cars and their movements were detected
								after executing a series of algorithm. Based on the detection, traffic lights could be manipulated.
								This was later improved by implementing 5 different techniques and analyzing all of them in an extensive testing strategy
								to analyze the tradeoffs between CPU load/heat/time-taken to execute and accuracy of output data.

						<div class="blog-slider__text">This was a 1 month project including implementation of all 5 techniques and analysis of trade-offs and was done in March 2021.
							<div class="mobiledisable">
								Analysis and optical flow calculation took most time.
								Getting basics ready was easy due to the lower-level implementations implicitly handled by OpenCV itself.
								This implementation runs wherever C++ could be run.
								There was no OS restriction as it was supposed to work on a large scale for traffic signal manipulation.

						<div class="blog-slider__title">Resources Used and Skills Learnt</div>
						<div class="blog-slider__text">OpenCV documentation was the most used resource as it had proper examples highlighting each implementation.
							This project gave me enough knowledge needed to fully get into computer vision using lower-level ML implementation.
							<div class="mobiledisable">
								This was the first program where I used threading.
								This was also the first time where I analyzed various trade-offs extensively using graphs and generate a report out of it.
								Tradeoff Analysis was a major skill learnt here.
								Developing a metric/index for analysis and graphing them for better visualization was highly beneficial.
